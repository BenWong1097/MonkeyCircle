# MonkeyCircle (Sandbox)
This repo will contain a sequence of projects, building up to a functional application that allows users to video chat and play a Godot-based game!
You'll probably want to skim a primer or two for [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) and [nginx](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/) before barging in here 🐱‍💻
Some skills enshrined in this repo:
- WebRTC basics
- Godot's version of WebRTC
- Godot's server setup
